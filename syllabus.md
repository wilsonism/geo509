## I. Course Description

Drawing on the last twenty-five years of scholarship in critical cartography and critical GIS, this workshop begins from the premise that maps are more than windows on the world. Maps do not only provide a record of geographic phenomena but actually impact the conditions of knowing itself. This ‘more-than-representational’ viewpoint enables a productive urgency at the heart of a collaborative or participatory mapping endeavor. Therefore, the goal for this course is to prepare each student as a responsive and responsible mapmaker, at a moment in digital culture when there are many maps but *few stories being told through them*. To meet this goal, this course develops the concept of the ‘community mapshop’ -- an intensive studio experience in which students use mapping technologies in collaboration with community partners. These partnerships will involve students in a full range of collaborative mapmaking: working with peers and community partners to invest in a study area, acquire and prepare data for spatial analyses, communicating with those impacted by or implicated in these analyses, and produce compelling geographic representations.

## II. Learning Objectives

This course will expose students to the technical, critical, and collaborative skills necessary to analyze a range of human and environmental phenomena using tools of geographic representation. The studio model will allow students to develop and apply these skills in partnership with community organizations. This course is designed to help students:
* Extend their skills in digital data preparation and handling in a mapping environment,
* Gain experience across the full range of steps and tasks that comprise GIS applications,
* Practice skills that will help them navigate partnerships in mapping work,
* Become an independent and ethical mapmaker who is prepared to work in a diversity of institutional, geographical, and political contexts, and
* Produce an applied mapping project from start to finish that may be used to showcase their cartographic and GIS abilities to future employers or academic programs.

## III. Format

This course will be composed entirely of studio sessions, which may involve some skill sharing, technical demonstrations, and guest speakers from the community. There will be in-class and extensive out-of-class assignments, and part of students’ assessments will be based on their observational and data collection work ‘in the field’. In our studio sessions, students will be expected to work constructively with their fellow classmates and visiting community partners.

## IV. Required Texts

While there are no required texts for this course, materials will be made available to students as necessary for the development of the studio projects. Students will be encouraged to conduct their own literature search and annotation for sharing with the studio.

## V. Assignments, Activities, and Grading

### Assessment overview.

Students will be assessed in this course using a variety of methods. Attendance and participation in studio is fundamental to successful completion of the course. Assessment is distributed in the following ways, for a total of 350 points:
* [Site analysis](site-analysis-LOU/README.md) (30 points)
* Technology demonstration (20 points)
* Midterm review (100 points)
* Final review (100 points)
* Final report (50 points)
* Class participation (50 points)

Final grades will be based on a standard scale, i.e., A=90-100%; B=80-89%; C=70-79%; D=60-69%; E=less than 60%. Grades for all assignments will be available via the University of Kentucky Canvas system (http://uk.instructure.com).

### Site analysis.

To jump-start the studio, students will complete an initial site analysis of the study area using GIS, to include primary and secondary spatial data. Analysis should highlight and prioritize more formal lines of inquiry that will be pursued throughout the semester, with an identification of potential community partners that could be engaged during the studio. Students are encouraged to use QGIS and/or ArcGIS.

### Technology demonstration.

During the first few weeks of the semester, each student will sign-up for, prepare, and perform a technology demonstration during, or immediately following, the completion of their site analyses. This demonstration will require that the student show the instructor an ability to download spatial data, perform a tabular join with Census data, and visualize this joined data using an appropriate symbology.

### Midterm review.

Students will prepare a midterm review as a formalization of work-to-date completed in the studio. Progress will be demonstrated in three areas: (1) more advanced and focused geographic representation from the site analysis, (2) identification of potential community partners and elaboration of specific needs to be addressed, and (3) outline of next steps in refining the analysis, representation, and, as appropriate, the program. Evaluation of the midterm review will occur during class, with invited guest reviewers and community partners. Students with overlapping interests may choose to pair-up for the midterm review, with permission of the instructor.

### Final review.

The final review will need to demonstrate incorporation of feedback from the midterm review and further refinement of the project. Evaluation of the final review will occur during class, with invited guest reviewers and community partners. Students with overlapping interests may choose to pair-up for the final review, with permission of instructor, but **each student** must prepare a final report.

### Final report.

A final report (no more than two-pages, single-spaced, with illustrations included as appendices) should (1) communicate the current state of knowledge regarding the study area, (2) briefly overview the work completed, and (3) discuss the significance of this work and identify further work to be completed. The report may be directed to a specific community partner or organization. Supporting illustrations should be included as appendices in the final report. Delivery of final report should be as a PDF, with a compressed ZIP folder containing all original documents, map files, as well as primary and secondary data. Students are encouraged to submit drafts of the final report for feedback at least one week in advance of the final report deadline.

### Class participation.

While attendance will not be taken, students are expected to attend all scheduled studio sessions. Throughout the semester, desk critiques will be conducted by the instructor and peer students and these ‘desk crits’ will contribute to a final evaluation of class participation.

## VI. Important Notices

### Prepare for this course.

Review the course syllabus carefully, paying special attention to due dates and assignment instructions. If you have questions about course expectations as overviewed by this syllabus, please contact the instructor as soon as possible.

### Attend class.

Attendance is not taken nor required, however, note that:
1. the majority of your grade depends on your preparation for, and engagement in, studio;
2. your success in pushing your technical knowledge of emerging representational technologies largely depends on the effort you apply in studio;
3. in the event of an absence, you should consult the syllabus and your peers regarding what material you have missed.

### Wear a mask.

In accordance with University guidelines, students must wear UK-approved face coverings in the classroom and academic buildings (e.g., faculty offices, laboratories, libraries, performance/design studios, and common study areas where students might congregate). If UK-approved face coverings are not worn over the nose and mouth, students will be asked to leave the classroom.

### Be in contact.

You are responsible for checking your UKY email account; Canvas is what will be used to send communications outside class. Email is the best way to contact the instructor. Please allow at least 24 hours for a response by email during weekdays. The instructor will not necessarily respond to emails over the weekends.

### Be a resource for others.

Students are strongly encouraged to exchange contact information with classmates, in order to facilitate the objectives of this studio.

### Get permission before recording.

Meetings of this course may be recorded. All video and audio recordings of lecturers and class meetings, provided by the instructors, are for educational use by students in this class only.
