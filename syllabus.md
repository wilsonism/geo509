## I. Course Description

Drawing on the last twenty-five years of scholarship in critical cartography and critical GIS, this workshop begins from the premise that maps are more than windows on the world. Maps do not only provide a record of geographic phenomena but actually impact the conditions of knowing itself. This ‘more-than-representational’ viewpoint enables a productive urgency at the heart of a collaborative or participatory mapping endeavor. Therefore, the goal for this course is to prepare each student as a responsive and responsible mapmaker, at a moment in digital culture when there are many maps but *few stories being told through them*. To meet this goal, this course develops the concept of the ‘community mapshop’ -- an intensive studio experience in which students use mapping technologies in collaboration with community partners. These partnerships will involve students in a full range of collaborative mapmaking: working with peers and community partners to invest in a study area, acquire and prepare data for spatial analyses, communicating with those impacted by or implicated in these analyses, and produce compelling geographic representations.

## II. Learning Objectives

This course will expose students to the technical, critical, and collaborative skills necessary to analyze a range of human and environmental phenomena using tools of geographic representation. The studio model will allow students to develop and apply these skills in partnership with community organizations. This course is designed to help students:
* Extend their skills in digital data preparation and handling in a mapping environment,
* Gain experience across the full range of steps and tasks that comprise GIS applications,
* Practice skills that will help them navigate partnerships in mapping work,
* Become an independent and ethical mapmaker who is prepared to work in a diversity of institutional, geographical, and political contexts, and
* Produce an applied mapping project from start to finish that may be used to showcase their cartographic and GIS abilities to future employers or academic programs.

## III. Format

This course will be composed entirely of studio sessions, which may involve some skill sharing, technical demonstrations, and guest speakers from the community. There will be in-class and extensive out-of-class assignments, and part of students’ assessments will be based on their observational and data collection work ‘in the field’. In our studio sessions, students will be expected to work constructively with their fellow classmates and visiting community partners.

## IV. Required Texts

While there are no required texts for this course, materials will be made available to students as necessary for the development of the studio projects. Students will be encouraged to conduct their own literature search and annotation for sharing with the studio.

## V. Assignments, Activities, and Grading

### Assessment overview.

Students will be assessed in this course using a variety of methods. Attendance and participation in studio is fundamental to successful completion of the course. Assessment is distributed in the following ways, for a total of 350 points:
* [Site analysis](site-analysis/README.md) (30 points)
* Technology demonstration (20 points)
* Midterm review (100 points)
* Final review (100 points)
* Final report (50 points)
* Class participation (50 points)

Final grades will be based on a standard scale, i.e., A=90-100%; B=80-89%; C=70-79%; D=60-69%; E=less than 60%. Grades for all assignments will be available via the University of Kentucky Canvas system (http://uk.instructure.com).

### Site analysis.

To jump-start the studio, students will complete an initial site analysis of the study area using GIS, to include primary and secondary spatial data. Analysis should highlight and prioritize more formal lines of inquiry that will be pursued throughout the semester, with an identification of potential community partners that could be engaged during the studio. Students are encouraged to use QGIS and/or ArcGIS.

### Technology demonstration.

During the first few weeks of the semester, each student will sign-up for, prepare, and perform a technology demonstration during, or immediately following, the completion of their site analyses. This demonstration will require that the student show the instructor an ability to download spatial data, perform a tabular join with Census data, and visualize this joined data using an appropriate symbology.

### Midterm review.

Students will prepare a midterm review as a formalization of work-to-date completed in the studio. Progress will be demonstrated in three areas: (1) more advanced and focused geographic representation from the site analysis, (2) identification of potential community partners and elaboration of specific needs to be addressed, and (3) outline of next steps in refining the analysis, representation, and, as appropriate, the program. Evaluation of the midterm review will occur during class, with invited guest reviewers and community partners. Students with overlapping interests may choose to pair-up for the midterm review, with permission of the instructor.

### Final review.

The final review will need to demonstrate incorporation of feedback from the midterm review and further refinement of the project. Evaluation of the final review will occur during class, with invited guest reviewers and community partners. Students with overlapping interests may choose to pair-up for the final review, with permission of instructor, but **each student** must prepare a final report.

### Final report.

A final report (no more than two-pages, single-spaced, with illustrations included as appendices) should (1) communicate the current state of knowledge regarding the study area, (2) briefly overview the work completed, and (3) discuss the significance of this work and identify further work to be completed. The report may be directed to a specific community partner or organization. Supporting illustrations should be included as appendices in the final report. Delivery of final report should be as a PDF, with a compressed ZIP folder containing all original documents, map files, as well as primary and secondary data. Students are encouraged to submit drafts of the final report for feedback at least one week in advance of the final report deadline.

### Class participation.

While attendance will not be taken, students are expected to attend all scheduled studio sessions. Throughout the semester, desk critiques will be conducted by the instructor and peer students and these ‘desk crits’ will contribute to a final evaluation of class participation.

## VI. Important Notices

### Prepare for this course.

Review the course syllabus carefully, paying special attention to due dates and assignment instructions. If you have questions about course expectations as overviewed by this syllabus, please contact the instructor as soon as possible.

### Attend class.

Attendance is not taken nor required, however, note that:
1. the majority of your grade depends on your preparation for, and engagement in, studio;
2. your success in pushing your technical knowledge of emerging representational technologies largely depends on the effort you apply in studio;
3. in the event of an absence, you should consult the syllabus and your peers regarding what material you have missed.

### Be in contact.

Students are responsible for checking their UKY email account; Canvas is what will be used to send communications outside class. Email is the best way to contact the instructor. Students should allow at least 24 hours for a response by email during weekdays. The instructor will not necessarily respond to emails over the weekends.

### Be a resource for others.

Students are strongly encouraged to exchange contact information with classmates, in order to facilitate the objectives of this studio.

### Get permission before recording.

Meetings of this course may be recorded. All video and audio recordings of lecturers and class meetings, provided by the instructors, are for educational use by students in this class only. They are available only through the Canvas shell for this course and are not to be copied, shared, or redistributed.

The University of Kentucky Student Code of Conduct defines Invasion of Privacy as using electronic or other devices to make a photographic, audio, or video record of any person without their prior knowledge or consent when such a recording is likely to cause injury or distress. As addressed in the Student Code of Conduct, students are expected to follow appropriate university policies and maintain the security of linkblue accounts used to access recorded class materials. Recordings may not be reproduced, shared with those not enrolled in the class, or uploaded to other online environments.

If the instructor or a University of Kentucky office plans any other uses for the recordings, beyond this class, students identifiable in the recordings will be notified to request consent prior to such use. In anticipation of such cases, students may be asked to complete an “authorization of use” form by a faculty member.

Video and audio recordings by students are not permitted during the class unless the student has received prior permission from the instructor. Any sharing, distribution, and or uploading of these recordings outside of the parameters of the class is prohibited.

### Meet deadlines.

Meeting deadlines is an important professional practice. Students should consult the course schedule, below, for the due dates of the course assignments. A 10-percent deduction will be applied to the final score of an assignment for submissions after the deadline on the same calendar day, with an additional 10-percent deduction for each additional calendar day the assignment is late. If the assignment is not delivered by the next class meeting, the assignment will not be accepted.

### Be honest.

This course, if successful, will expose students to a variety of concepts and techniques. Students are expected to draw upon these various ideas, but they must be transparent and honest about their use of these ideas. Students should get help if they are uncertain about this expectation. Per university policy, students shall not plagiarize, cheat, or falsify or misuse academic records. Students should familiarize themselves with definitions regarding plagiarism (available at [https://ombud.uky.edu/students/what-plagiarism](https://ombud.uky.edu/students/what-plagiarism)) and cheating (available at [https://ombud.uky.edu/students/what-cheating](https://ombud.uky.edu/students/what-cheating). Please note: Any assignment students turn in may be submitted to an electronic database to check for plagiarism.

### Be respectful.

Students should at all times be respectful of fellow students, the professor or teaching assistant(s), and the University of Kentucky. Some basic reminders:
* Silence all mobile devices.
* Show up on time. Late arrivals (and unnecessary) early departures are rude and disruptive.
* Put away your reading material (other than materials necessary for the lecture/course).
* Talking and whispering during class is disrespectful to the professor and fellow students and makes it more difficult for those who want to learn to do so.
* Be attentive to and respectful of other students’ contributions to class discussions. Discussion must not include attacks of a personal nature, including denigrating another on the basis of skin color, sex, religion, sexual orientation, age, national/regional origin or other such irrelevant factors.

### Renew your commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

The University of Kentucky is committed to our core values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and human dignity, and a sense of community (Governing Regulations XIV, available at [https://www.uky.edu/regs/gr14](https://www.uky.edu/regs/gr14)). We acknowledge and respect the seen and unseen diverse identities and experiences of all members of the university community ([https://www.uky.edu/regs/gr14](https://www.uky.edu/regs/gr14)). These identities include but are not limited to those based on race, ethnicity, gender identity and expressions, ideas and perspectives, religious and cultural beliefs, sexual orientation, national origin, age, ability, and socioeconomic status. We are committed to equity and justice and providing a learning and engaging community in which every member is engaged, heard, and valued.

We strive to rectify and change behavior that is inconsistent with our principles and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. If students encounter such behavior in a course, they are encouraged to speak with the instructor of record and/or the Office of Institutional Equity and Equal Opportunity (available at [https://www.uky.edu/eeo/](https://www.uky.edu/eeo/)). Students may also contact a faculty member within the department, program director, the director of undergraduate or graduate studies, the department chair, any college administrator, or the dean. All of these individuals are mandatory reporters under University policies.

### Familiarize yourself with campus-wide policies.

To learn more about campus-wide policies on Excused Absences and Acceptable Excuses, Religious Observances, Verification of Absences, Make-Up Work, Excused Absences for Military Duties, Unexcused Absences, Prep Week and Reading Days, Accommodation Due to Disability, Non-Discrimination Statement and Title IX Information, students should refer to Academic Policy Statements (available at [https://provost.uky.edu/proposals/guidance-course-proposals/standard-academic-policy-statements](https://provost.uky.edu/proposals/guidance-course-proposals/standard-academic-policy-statements)). Students should contact the instructor with any questions regarding these policies.

### Review information regarding classroom emergency preparedness and response

Nothing is more important than the safety and well-being of our campus community. While the University of Kentucky Police Department continues to enhance campus safety measures, it’s important to remember that everyone has a responsibility in keeping our community safe. To find more information visit [https://police.uky.edu/emergency-response-guide](Emergency Response Guide) created by the University of Kentucky Police Department.

**Emergency Reporting & Action**
*Reporting*: If there is an emergency, DIAL 911. To report suspicious activity or non-emergency situations, call the UK Police Department at 859-257-8573 or #UKPD from any mobile phone. If an emergency occurs in a classroom or residence hall with a red emergency button, press to quickly notify UKPD. Emergency responders will immediately be dispatched to your location.
*Action*: During an emergency, you are responsible for your own safety. If an emergency occurs during class, your instructor will provide further direction based on university and department emergency plans.

**Warning Systems**
*UK Alert*: The university provides emergency notifications through UK Alert, which sends messages via email, text message, phone calls, building alarm systems, digital signage, social media and outdoor sirens. If you receive a UK Alert message during class, notify your instructor and classmates immediately. For more information, visit [https://police.uky.edu/get-notified/uk-alert](https://police.uky.edu/get-notified/uk-alert).
*LiveSafe*: The university provides additional emergency preparedness information and safety tools through LiveSafe, a free mobile app for iOS and Android. You can report suspicious activity, message with UK Police and virtually escort your friends through the SafeWalk tool. For more information, visit [https://police.uky.edu/safety/livesafe](https://police.uky.edu/safety/livesafe).
*Blue Emergency Towers*: Blue Emergency Notification Towers are strategically placed at over 50 locations across campus to provide outdoor alert tones and broadcast emergency messages with loud speakers. Each tower also features an emergency push button speaker phone that reaches UKPD and a camera mounted above the tower.
For more information, visit [https://police.uky.edu/safety/blue-emergency-towers](https://police.uky.edu/safety/blue-emergency-towers).

**Medical Emergency**
If there is a medical emergency, dial 911 and do not act outside the scope of your medical training. After dialing 911, inform your instructor of the situation.

**Evacuation**
It is required to evacuate for a fire alarm or when university officials order us to do so. Evacuation routes are marked with illuminated exit signs throughout the building. Avoid using elevators during any evacuation.

**Emergency Sheltering**
*Storm Sheltering*: Report to the recommended shelter locations. Recommended shelter locations are marked throughout the building. If shelter locations are unavailable, protect yourself from lightning and flying debris by moving to an interior room or hallway on the building's lowest level. Avoid outside doors and windows and get under a sturdy table and use your arms to protect your head and neck.
*Shelter-in-Place*: If a shelter-in-place order is issued, you will learn about this through UK Alert, the university’s emergency notification system. If you are inside, stay where you are unless the building you are in is affected. If the building is affected, and the fire alarm has been activated or directed by law enforcement, you should evacuate. If you are outdoors, proceed into the closest UK building or follow instructions from emergency personnel or alerts. It is ideal to shelter-in-place in an interior room with the fewest or no windows and no doors to the outside if
possible. Shut all windows and close exterior doors. If a hazardous chemical release occurs outside the building, follow these same procedures.

**Active Aggressor**
In a situation where an aggressor is trying to attack you or others, follow three steps:
1. Run: Attempt to get away from the attacker.
2. Hide: If you cannot run, barricade yourself in a safe place. Turn your phone to silent and dim your brightness. If possible, use the LiveSafe App to message UK Police and alert them to your location. If you don’t have the app, dial 911. If you cannot speak, leave the line open and allow the dispatcher to listen.
3. Fight: If you cannot run or hide, do whatever you need to do to stop the attacker.
UK Police will communicate additional information through the UK Alert system during an active aggressor situation. Every UKY email automatically receives UK Alerts. You can also sign up in myUK to receive alerts via text and phone call.
